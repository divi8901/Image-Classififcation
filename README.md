# Image-Classififcation
# Cat vs Dog Image Classification

A deep learning project for binary image classification to distinguish between cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Python with TensorFlow/Keras.

##  Project Overview

This project aims to build an image classifier that can differentiate between images of cats and dogs. It uses a CNN model trained on a labeled dataset of cat and dog images. The model is evaluated for accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix performance.

##  Key Features

- Preprocessing of image data (resizing, normalization)
- Data augmentation for improved generalization
- CNN-based model architecture using TensorFlow/Keras
- Training and validation on a split dataset
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, loss, confusion matrix
- Save and load trained model for inference
